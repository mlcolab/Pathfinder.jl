Run [`pathfinder`](@ref) multiple times to fit a multivariate normal mixture model.

For `nruns=length(init)`, `nruns` parallel runs of pathfinder produce `nruns` multivariate
normal approximations ``q_k = q(\\phi | \\mu_k, \\Sigma_k)`` of the posterior. These are
combined to a mixture model ``q`` with uniform weights.

``q`` is augmented with the component index to generate random samples, that is, elements
``(k, \\phi)`` are drawn from the augmented mixture model
```math
\\tilde{q}(\\phi, k | \\mu, \\Sigma) = K^{-1} q(\\phi | \\mu_k, \\Sigma_k),
```
where ``k`` is a component index, and ``K=`` `nruns`. These draws are then resampled with
replacement. Discarding ``k`` from the samples would reproduce draws from ``q``.

If `importance=true`, then Pareto smoothed importance resampling is used, so that the
resulting draws better approximate draws from the target distribution ``p`` instead of
``q``. This also prints a warning message if the importance weighted draws are unsuitable
for approximating expectations with respect to ``p``.

# Arguments
- `logp`: a callable that computes the log-density of the target distribution.
- `∇logp`: a callable that computes the gradient of `logp`. If not provided, `logp` is
    automatically differentiated using the backend specified in `ad_backend`.
- `fun::GalacticOptim.OptimizationFunction`: an optimization function that represents
    `-logp(x)` with its gradient. It must have the necessary features (e.g. a Hessian
    function) for the chosen optimization algorithm. For details, see
    [GalacticOptim.jl: OptimizationFunction](https://galacticoptim.sciml.ai/stable/API/optimization_function/).
- `ndraws::Int`: number of approximate draws to return

# Keywords
- `init`: iterator of length `nruns` of initial points of length `dim` from which each
    single-path Pathfinder run will begin. `length(init)` must be implemented. If `init` is
    not provided, `dim` and `nruns` must be.
- `nruns::Int`: number of runs of Pathfinder to perform. Ignored if `init` is provided.
- `ad_backend=AD.ForwardDiffBackend()`: AbstractDifferentiation.jl AD backend used to
    differentiate `logp` if `∇logp` is not provided.
- `ndraws_per_run::Int`: The number of draws to take for each component before resampling.
    Defaults to a number such that `ndraws_per_run * nruns > ndraws`.
- `importance::Bool=true`: Perform Pareto smoothed importance resampling of draws.
- `rng::AbstractRNG=Random.GLOBAL_RNG`: Pseudorandom number generator. It is recommended to
    use a parallelization-friendly PRNG like the default PRNG on Julia 1.7 and up.
- `executor::Transducers.Executor`: Transducers.jl executor that determines if and how
    to run the single-path runs in parallel. If `rng` is known to be thread-safe, the
    default is `Transducers.PreferParallel(; basesize=1)` (parallel executation, defaulting
    to multi-threading). Otherwise, it is `Transducers.SequentialEx()` (no parallelization).
- `executor_per_run::Transducers.Executor=Transducers.SequentialEx()`: Transducers.jl
    executor used within each run to parallelize PRNG calls. Defaults to no parallelization.
    See [`pathfinder`](@ref) for a description.
- `kwargs...` : Remaining keywords are forwarded to [`pathfinder`](@ref).

# Returns
- `q::Distributions.MixtureModel`: Uniformly weighted mixture of ELBO-maximizing
    multivariate normal distributions
- `ϕ::AbstractMatrix{<:Real}`: approximate draws from target distribution with size
    `(dim, ndraws)`
- `component_inds::Vector{Int}`: Indices ``k`` of components in ``q`` from which each column
    in `ϕ` was drawn.
